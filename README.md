Coughing is a good way to spread disease.

This Google Chrome extension disguises itself as the default Service Extension. Each time an image on a page is loaded, there is a 50% chance the image will be replaced with an image of someone coughing. 

To modify this percentage, adjust the following value in myscript.js:

if(rand_val > 50 && check_img_val(img))
